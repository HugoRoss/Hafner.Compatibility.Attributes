# Hafner.Compatibility.Attributes

This is a meta-package that includes other `Hafner.Compatibility.*` packages as needed which provide various attributes that are missing in older frameworks.

Currently, the following attributes are supported (listed below are the frameworks that are lacking the according attribute and for which this package is adding it):

 - `System.Runtime.InteropServices.GuidAttribute`
   - `.NET Standard 1.0`

For all the other supported frameworks the assembly is only an empty shell.
